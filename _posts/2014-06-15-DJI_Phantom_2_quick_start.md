title: DJI Phantom 2 Quick Start

# DJI Phantom 2

The EPSCoR Modern Blanket Toss crew allowed me to borrow one of their DJI
Phantom 2 systems to learn how to fly. During processes of learning how
to launch the device I found myself in my classic "I just want to do it" vs
"I should probably read the manual".  Turns out DJI has a collection of very
nice videos, instructions, wiki's, and community information flying around the
internet but none of it consisted of what I would call a quick start. The
following is my version of a quick start.

# Quick Start for DJI Phantom 2

## Learn how to fly first

Before I did anything with this very expensive tool I learned how to fly
a quad copter using a much less expensive quad copter platform.  I highly
recommend investing in a
[HubSan X4 107C](http://www.hubsan.com/products/HELICOPTER/H107C.htm) which you
can pick up at
[Amazon for $60](http://www.amazon.com/Hubsan-H107C-2-4G-Quadcopter-Camera/dp/B00EXBDWZC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402872076&sr=8-1&keywords=hubsan+107c).

Not only did that give me the ability to learn by crashing something that both
didn't hurt myself or others but only cost a few dollars to replace the props
while figuring out the controls.

## Unboxing and preparing
* Charge the batteries - this will take 40 minutes per battery
* Insert batteries in Remote Controller (4 AAs)
* Install Ground Control on iPad
* Batteries still charging - go check out DJI documentation:
  * [User Manual](http://www.dji.com/product/phantom-2/download)
  * [Quick Start guide](http://download.dji-innovations.com/downloads/phantom_2/en/PHANTOM2_Quick_Start_Guide_en.pdf)

## Batteries

There is a bit of a trick to 'turning on' and 'turning off' the batteries.  I
received batteries that didn't have their brand new 'how to use them' stickers
but a bit of digging turned up the answer:

*Turn On* - press button once - then press and hold for 2 seconds

*Turn Off* - Same deal - press button once - then press and hold for 2 seconds

## Launch

* Prepare Remote Controller
  * S1 and S2 to top most positions
  * Turn Remote Controller ON before starting up Phantom
* Insert battery
  * Press button once - then press and hold for 2 seconds
* Wait for the following states in the blinking lights:
  * Blinking or Solid green
* Turn on camera (not to WiFi mode)
  * Pre
