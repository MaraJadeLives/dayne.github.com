# Projects & Roles

Summary of key projects and roles I have lead as either a primary investigator (PI), as a co-PI, or been the leading project manager of the project.

### Primary Investigator (PI):
* 2021-2024: Alaska Regional Collaboration for Technology, Innovation and
  Commercialization (ARCTIC) II.  The ARCTIC II project expanded the existing
program with the development of Community Innovation Network in Alaska.
  * Lead the development & implimentation of the grant.
  * Program lead for a
* 2019-2022: Eielson Resiliency Microgrid & Research Data Archive
  * Lead the UAF team to support the Eaton Corporation's project to deply an advanced metering system on the Eielson Air Force base to detect, understand, and develop ways to dealw ith power quality issues. 
* 2010-2016: Susitna-Watana Hydroelectric Project Geospatial data management.
  * Lead GINA team in supporting the Alaska Energy Authority in creating a geospatial collaboration platform and distribution platform for large and complex geospatial datasets.
* 2017-2018: Susitna-Watana Hydroelectric Cumulative data archive and distribution project.  
  * Maintain the the long term archive the full cumulative data collected for the Alaska Energy Authority Susitna-Watana Hydroelectric program so the datasets are available to the general public and agency users well into the future.
* 2017: North Slope Science Initiative 
  * Provide geospatial catalog and services to support the collection, discovery, and archiving of science datasets for the North Slope of Alaska. 
* 2015-2018: Alaska Department of Natural Resources - Geospatial collaboration project with Forestry
  * Lead a shared service effort to collaborate on cyber-infrastructure and geospatial collaboration platforms.  Developed and maintained a Linux based ESRI ArcGIS Server and file storage system between Anchorage and Fairbanks that used visualization to provide fail-over, development/testing environments, and redundancy between data centers.
* 2017: Alaska Energy Authority - Community Data Dashboard
  * Lead the design and development team for a community dashboard that explored key community datasets available from Alaska Energy Authority and the Alaska Energy 
* 2009-2018 : AEA Alaska Energy Data Inventory
  Lead GINA's support to Alaska Energy Authority's Energy Data Inventory project.  
  * Assisted in the collection, management, and visualization of geospatial datasets for the Alaska Energy Authority. Managed the GIS and development team in the creation of custom data catalogs and web based visualizations to support AEA.
* 2016: AK-DNR Tundra Travel Monitoring Services & Website - Alaska Department of Natural Resources Ice Roads.
  * Developed a web application for DNR ice road managers to capture field observations, set flags for ice road zones, and make the current status of each DNR ice road zone available to the general public and ice road industry.
* 2015-2016: Alaska Energy Authority - Affordable Energy Strategy Model.  
  * Lead the design and development team to create the Alaska Affordable Energy Model (AAEM). The goal of the AAEM was to provide Alaska with a community energy model and project evaluation tool using community and regional energy data, fuel data, and socio-economic data to allow the: 1) estimation and forecasting of heating and electricity consumption by sector, 2) compare the ability of energy infrastructure project types (efficiency, renewable energy, fuel switching) to reduce the cost of energy in communities, and 3) determine the capital investment needed and the resulting energy savings to communities.
  * Successfully managed the project through the design and development of the model, packaging of the model for use in local environments, and the model results website and dashboard for the browsing of the model results. 

### CO-I or lead project manager:
* 2019-2021: DOE CDPS
  * Program Director for the Dept. of Energy EPSCoR implimentation grant _Development and validation of models to assess dynamic response of converter-dominated power systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales_ a.k.a Modeling of Converter Dominated Power Systems (CDPS).  A research partnership between energy research teams in Alaska, South Dakota, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii.
* 2016-2017: Strategic Studies for Alaska - ASRC Federal Mission Solutions LLC 
  * Partnered with ASRC to identify new research tasks and support their implementation.
    * Evaluation of satellite bases sea ice monitoring and remote sensing and managed 
    * Managed an intern program of UAF students/ASRC interns were embedded with GINA.  Oversaw intern development of a Raspberry Pi based temperature system package for monitoring ice cellar health.
