### (2009 era)

Dayne Broderson is a IT specialist, manager, and researcher with a focus towards goespatial and remote sensing data streams. Dayne has a Bachealor of Science in Computer Science.  Dayne is the technical services manager for the Goegraphic Information Network of Alaska (GINA) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  In this role Dayne has lead and managed the mapping and remote sensing efforts of alaska.

In 2009 I was promoted to Technical Services Manager at GINA.  In this position, I serve as the principal investigator and co-investigator on multiple grant-funded projects.   Additionally, I have hired, trained, supervised, and mentored a team of 10-12 developers, system administrators, and GIS professionals.  I have lead the growth of GINA IT from a small multi-rack operation in a single datacenter managed by a single system administrator into a complex multi-site, multi-partner system that relies on the coordination and collaboration of numerous groups from within the University and from federal and state agency partners.  Our project partners include the National Science Foundation, NOAA, NASA, the Alaska Energy Authority, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, and Quantum Spatial.
